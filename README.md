# DraftJS: Export ContentState to HTML

This is a module for [DraftJS](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js) that will export your editor content to semantic HTML.

It was originally extracted from [React-RTE](https://react-rte.org) and put into its own module for more general use.

This project is still under development. If you want to help out, please open an issue to discuss or join us on [Slack](https://draftjs.slack.com/).
